# Computer Science

In Computer Science, we study computation and information.

For a programmer, developer, software engineer, whichever you prefer, the field of Computer Science can be a source of great use. However, it is not the bread and butter.

If we accept that Computer Science is a collection of theoretical disciplines, then we can also accept that for the average programmer for whom practicality is the primary concern, Computer Science is a helpful friend, but not the only thing needed to get the job done.

That being said, there are some incredibly useful aspects of Computer Science, that are helpful to understand for any programmer, and certainly not a disadvantage. In this chapter, we are going to cover some of these aspects.
